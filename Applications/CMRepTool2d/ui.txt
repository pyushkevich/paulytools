Boundariness Plots:
This graph plots boundariness along the vector normal to the boundary.  The function is plotted from three standard deviations along the normal.
Gradient Direction Dials:
This round graph shows the direction in which the image derivative is strongest (gradient direction) in yellow.  The current direction of the primitive is plotted in red.  Boundariness is greatest when the arrows coinside.
Left/Right Boundary Attributes:
Information about the left and right boundary sites is displayed here.  The boundary sites are distinguished by color in the main window (left=cyan and right=purple).  Position, direction of the normal and aperture of the boundariness filter are shown here.
Medial Primitive Attributes:
This part of the editor contains the attributes of a medial primitive that can be edited.  Besides position (x,y) and radius (r) there are four attributes.  Axial angle is the direction of the bisector of the primitive; object angle determines the narrowing rate of the object; polarity reverses the direction of the boundary filter and endcap distance (in units of radius) affects the elongation of the end primitive.  
Scale Space Viewer Help
Scale Space Display:
In this window the slices of the scale space generated by the image can be seen.  The scale slider changes the aperture of the Gaussian blurring kernel.  The zoom slider causes the window to compute only every 4th,9th or 16th pixel for faster display.

Core Wizard
Step 1.  Place Seed Primitive
Your model has been temporarily hidden and a seed primitive was inserted into the scene.  Place the seed primitive at a position in the image where you want to start extracting the core.  The radius, axial and boundary angles of the primitive will be used to initialize core extraction.
Step 2.  Configure Core
Specify the following settings for the core:
Intervals at which the core will be searched for (pixels):
Step 3. Extract Core
Click the 'Start' button to start core extraction.  Click the 'Stop' button to stop tracing in either direction.  Use 'Clear' to remove the core.

Step 4. Create Model from Core
Use sliders below to set the end points on the core and the number of primitives in the resulting model.  Click 'Finish' when done.

Figure Interpolation
Interpolation:
Number of atoms:
Interpolation inserts one or more medial atoms between each pair of consecutive atoms in a figure.
Interpolate
Resampling:
Resampling the figure will cause the atoms to me moved to regular locations along the medial track, while the boundary remains intact.  This algorithm will place new atoms at equal distance from each other and keep the end atoms in place.
