
	SoPlex --- the Sequential Object-oriented simPlex

1.	All the documentation is available online at 

        http://www.zib.de/Optimization/Software/Soplex
        http://www.zib.de/Optimization/Software/Soplex/html/index.html

	you can also generate it, if you have doxgen installed by 
        typing 'gmake doc'. It will then be in doc/html/index.html

2.	Compiling

	Read the documentation!

        For the impatient:

	On systems with GNU g++   :  gmake COMP=gnu OPT=opt
	Linux/x86 with Intel C++  :  gmake COMP=intel OPT=opt
        Linux/AXP with Compaq C++ :  gmake COMP=compaq OPT=opt
        Solaris with SUN Forte C++:  gmake COMP=sun OPT=opt
        IRIX with SGI Mips Pro C++:  gmake COMP=sgi OPT=opt
	HP-UX with HP aCC         :  gmake COMP=hp OPT=opt
        AIX with VisualAge C++    :  gmake COMP=ibm OPT=opt

        Then get and unpack in the check directory the Netlib testset from 
        http://www.zib.de/Optimization/Software/Soplex/netlib.tgz
        and say gmake COMP=<as before> OPT=<as before> quick
        This should report no fails.

        Now read the documentation!

3.1	Using soplex

	Start one of the binaries in the bin directory with the -h flag.

3.2	Using the library

    	An example on how to use the soplex library is provided in the
	file 'src/example.cpp'. It shows how to read and solve LPs 
        with SoPlex. 

4.	Bug report

	If you find any bugs, or LP-files were SoPlex fails to find the
	optimal solution, please report to koch@zib.de.

5.	Publications

	Any publication for which SoPlex has been used must include an
	aknowledge ment and a reference to the Ph.D. thesis:

	Roland Wunderling,
	"Paralleler und Objekt-orientierter Simplex-Algorithmus",
	ZIB technical report TR 96-09, Berlin 1996

	A copy of the thesis can be retreived from
	www.zib.de/PaperWeb/abstracts/TR-96-09/
