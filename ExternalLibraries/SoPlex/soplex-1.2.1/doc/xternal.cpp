/**@page DataObjects Data Objects 

    \em Data \em objects refer to C++ objects that do not allocate any
    resources, particularly that do not allocate any memory.  This
    makes them behave just like ordinary C structures, in that both,
    the copy constructor and assignment operator are equivalent to a
    memcopy of the memory taken by the object. Examples for data
    objects are all builtin types such as #int or #double or
    \e simple classes such as #complex.
 
    We distinguish \em data \em objects from general C++ objects that
    may include some allocation of resources. (Note, that for general
    C++ objects that do allocate resources, this must be respected by
    providing apropriate copy constructor and assignment operators.)
    An example for a general C++ class is class DataArray.
 
    The distingtion between data and general C++ objects becomes
    relevant when using such objects in container classes such as
    DataArray or Array.

/**@page INST Installation
 
 \section Prequisites Prequisites 
 You need the following programs to compile SoPlex:

  - C++ compiler (e.g. http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc)
  - gnu make http://www.gnu.org/software/make
  - gnu awk http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk (if you want the check target)
  - doxygen http://www.doxygen.org (if you want to generate the documentation)

 After receiving SoPlex you have to uncompress it 
 (http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip) and 
 unpack it with and unpacked it (http://www.gnu.org/software/tar)
 into a directory. Then change to that directory.

 \section Tested Linux/x86, Linux/AXP, Tru64, Solaris, IRIX, HP-UX
 If you are working under one those OSes you should try the following:
 
 \c gmake \c COMP=xxx \c OPT=yyy

 with \c xxx being one of \c gnu, \c intel, \c sun, \c hp, \c sgi, \c compaq
 or \c ibm
 and \c yyy one of \c dbg (if you want the debug version) or \c opt 
 (if you want the optimized version).

 This should generate a binary in the \c bin subdirectory. 

 \section Others If the previous section was not for you
 At first the Makefile tries to find out the OS and the 
 architecture by using the \c uname command. 
 If your OS or architecture is missing, please update the 
 Makefile and submit the change to me.

 Then a submakefile from \c make/make.OS.ARCH.COMP.OPT is included in
 the main Makefile. You should adapt the compiler flags as needed.
 Be especially carefull with the \c AR setting since some C++ compilers do
 not like using the standard \c ar program together with code that uses
 templates.

 If this all does not work, change to the \c src directory and type

 \c CC \c *.cpp 

 This should do the trick. Adding \c -DNDEBUG gives you a non debugging 
 version. Add flags as needed. 

 \section Testing Testing the Binary
 After you compiled the binary you should get the Netlib LP files at
 http://www.zib.de/Optimization/Software/Soplex/netlib.tgz and
 unpack them in the \c check directory. Then you can try

 \c gmake \c COMP=xxx \c OPT=dbg \c quick

 \c gmake \c COMP=xxx \c OPT=opt \c quick

 \c gmake \c COMP=xxx \c OPT=opt \c check

 Use the check target together with \c OPT=dbg only if you have really 
 a lot of time. \c quick should run in a few minutes and \c check will 
 need between less than one hour and a day depending on your machine.

 \c quick should report no fails at all. \c check should report no fails in the
 \c LC and \c EC columns and in the \c LR and \c ER columns only with 
 the instances greenbea, greenbeb, pilot-ja or pilot87. 
 One or two fails is normal, above four is probably a problem with the 
 compiler. Look how big the error is. Try again with less optimization. 
 Our results are available at 
 http://www.zib.de/Optimization/Software/Soplex/results
 to compare with.

 \section Documentation  Generating the documentation
 If you have \c doygen (and \c dot) installed, you just can say 

 \c gmake \c doc

 After that the documentation should be in doc/html.

 \section Installation Installation
 The binary is in the \c bin directory, the library in \c lib and all
 headers are in \c src. Feel free to install at a suitable place.

 \section Naming Naming of the OPT Variable

  - dbg (debugging) -DNDEBUG is \b not set. Optimization is mostly off
    and debugging info is generated

  - std (standard) -DNDEBUG is set. All optimizations may be switch on,
    which do \b not \b alter the floating point behaviour or may 
    otherwise by result in wrong code 

  - opt (optimized) -DNDEBUG is set. All optimizations may be switch on,
    as long as the code seems to run correctly. The code should run
    on the relevant architectures. Best is something like -fast that
    uses the right optimizations for the architecture that is used.

  - opt-XXX (optimizied for XXX) like opt-p4. This includes optimization
    for a specific processor. 

  - prf (profile) like opt, but generate profile data.

  - XXX-ld (long-double) same as XXX but with long doubles.

/**@page FAQ Frequently Asked Questions

   Here are some answers that can not be answered from the code alone:

   <ol>
   <li> Why is <iostream> used but <assert.h> and not <cassert> ?
     
      The reason is twofold. From the theoretical point we were not
      able to exactly find out in TC++PL in what namespace cassert 
      should load it's declarations. Shurely in std. But since this are
      normally functions with C linkage this won't work.
      The some, like assert are macros, which have no namespace.
      The practical point is, that the compiler vendors seem to be 
      unsure also. Most put everything in both namespaces std and global.
      So there is no advantage in using <cassert>. Compaq even left them
      off because it seemed unclear to them.
      So our reasoning was: If it is a C++ header we use the correct form
      without the .h and in std. If it is a C header, according to the
      standard the .h header has to be there and uses global namespace.
      That seems acceptable to us, especially for C functions.
      
   <li> Why is malloc/free sometimes used and not new/delete ?
      
      Because there is no realloc with new/delete. Because malloc
      is faster. And we only use it for builtin types or so called 
      \ref DataObjects "Data Objects" .
      If you do not like this descision, it's quite easy to change 
      spxalloc.h to use new/delete.

   <li> Can SoPlex solve Integer Programs (IP's) ?
      
      No. You need an IP-Solver for this. Most IP-Solver use LP-Solvers
      as a subroutine and do some kind of Branch-and-Bound.

   <li> Is there a Windows version ?

      The code is tested to compile under some version of Visual C++.
      We do \b not provide any make or project files for VC++.

   <li> I want a primal and a dual simplex, where are they ?

      That is nearly easy. You can set SoPlex to use the  
      ENTERing and LEAVEing algorithm and
      COLUMN and ROW representation.

      <TABLE>
      <TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD>ENTER </TD><TD>LEAVE </TD></TR>
      <TR><TD>COLUMN</TD><TD>Primal</TD><TD>Dual  </TD></TR>
      <TR><TD>ROW   </TD><TD>Dual  </TD><TD>Primal</TD></TR>
      </TABLE>

      COLUMN oriented is the "usual" representation.
      Then Entering is the Primal and Leaving is the Dual algorithm.
      In ROW oriented representation, we have in principle the
      explicit dual and then the algorithms reverse.

      The only problem is that SoPlex is a composite simplex algorithm.
      That means it switches between entering and leaving algorithm
      as it needs. So all you can choose is which algorithm is used first,
      but then an arbitrary number of switches may occur. (Even so, often
      no switch at all happens.)

   <li> SoPlex means \em Sequential Simplex. Is there a parallel version
        available? 
 
      No. There was done research in this direction. You can find most of 
      the results in http://www.zib.de/PaperWeb/abstracts/TR-96-09 and 
      http://www.zib.de/PaperWeb/abstracts/SC-95-45 .

   <li> Is there a wrapper class/library to use SoPlex instead of CPLEX ? 

      No. 

   <li> Is there an interface for COIN ?

      Yes, have a look at 
      http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/coin/COIN

/**@page FLAGS How to use the flags in the example program

   Here are some tips on which flags to use with the example program:

   If yout have more constrains (rows) than variables (cols) it is 
   a good idea to try the \c -r flag.

   Setting \c -z to a smaller value like 1e-18 or 1e-20 might improve
   the quality of the solution, but may also slow down the
   program. Setting \c -z to bigger values may speed up the algorithm,
   but values greater than 1e-12 are definately a bad idea.

   Setting \c -d to smaller values like 1e-7 or 1e-8 will improve the
   quality of the solution, but it will take longer. Values smaller
   then 1e-9 are not recommended. The \c -d value should be
   substantial bigger then the \c -z value.

   If the default settings are too slow, using \c -e eventually together 
   with \c -p1 might improve the running time.

/**@page PROG Programming with SoPlex 
   
   The SoPlex class library comprises classes that may be categorized into
   three different types:

   - Elementary classes are provided for general purpose use in
     projects way bejond the scope of numerical software or linear
     programming.
   - Linear algebra classes provide basic data types for (sparse)
     linear algebra computations. However, their functionality is
     restricted to simple operations such as addition and scaling.
     For complex tasks, such as solving linear systems of equations,
     algorithmic classes are provided instead.
   - Algorithmic classes serve for implementing maybe a variaty of
     algorithms for solving numerical (sub-)problems.

   The following sections are dedicated to users, that want to
   provide own pricers, ratio test, start basis generation codes or
   LP simplifiers to use with #SoPlex or that want to derive own
   implementations (e.g. parallel versions) using SoPlex.

   @section Virtualizing the Representation
   The primal Simplex on the columnwise representation is
   structurely equivalent to the dual Simplex on the rowwise
   representation and vice versa (see above). Hence, it is
   desirable to treat both cases in a very similar manner. This
   is supported by the programmers interface of #Soplex, that
   provides access methods for all internal data in two ways: one
   is relative to the "physical" representation of the LP in
   rows and columns, while the other is relative to the chosen
   basis #Representation. If e.g. a #SPxPricer is
   written using the second type of methods only (which will
   generally be the case), the same code can be used for running
   SoPlex's the Simplex algorithm for both
   #Representation%s. We will now give two examples for this
   virtualization from the chosen representation.

   Methods #vector will return a column or a row vector,
   corresponding to the chosen basis representation. 
   The other "vectors" will be referred to as \em covectors:
     
   <TABLE>
   <TR><TD>&nbsp;  </TD><TD>ROW      </TD><TD>COLUMN   </TD></TR>
   <TR><TD>vector  </TD><TD>rowVector</TD><TD>colVector</TD></TR>
   <TR><TD>coVector</TD><TD>colVector</TD><TD>rowVector</TD></TR>
   </TABLE>
    
   Weather the #SPxBasis::Desc::Status of a variable indicates that the
   corresponding #vector is in the basis matrix or not also depends on the
   chosen representation. Hence, methods #isBasic() are provided to get the
   correct answer for both representations.  
   
   @section Simplex Vectors and Bounds
   The Simplex algorithms keeps three vectors, that are defined to a basis.
   Two of them are required for the pricing, while the other is needed for
   detecting feasibility of the basis. For all three vectors, bounds are
   defined. The Simplex alogrithm changes the basis until all three vectors
   satisfy their bounds. In this case the optimal solution is found.
    
   Whith each update of the basis, also the three vectors need to be
   updated. This is best supported by the use of #UpdateVector%s.
    
   @subsection Variables
   The Simplex algorithm works with two types of variables, primals and
   duals.  The primal variables are the ones associated to each column of
   an LP, whereas the dual variables are the ones associated to each row.
   However, to each row a slack variable must be added to the set of
   primals (to represent inequalities), and a reduced cost variable must be
   added for each column (to represent upper or lower bounds). Note, that
   mathematically, on dual variable for each bound (upper and lower) should
   be added. However, this variable would always yield the same value and
   can, hence, be implemented as one.
    
   To summarize, we have a primal variable for each LP column and row
   (i.e. its slack) as well as a dual variable for each LP row and column
   (i.e. its bounds). However, not all these values need to be stored and
   computed, since the structure of the Simplex algorithms allow to
   implicitely keep them.
      
   If the #SPxBasis's #Status of a row or column is one of #P_ON_LOWER,
   #P_ON_UPPER, #P_FIXED or #P_FREE the value of the corresponding
   primal variable is the lower, upper or both bound(s) or 0, respectively.
   The corresponding dual variable needs to be computed. Equivalently, for
   a #Status of #D_FREE, #D_ON_UPPER, #D_ON_LOWER, #D_ON_BOTH or
   #D_UNDEFINED the corresponding dual variable is 0, whereas the primal 
   one needs to be computed.

   We declare the following vectors for holding the values to be computed.
   Primal variables (dimension #nCols()): #primRhs, #primVec.
   Dual variables (dimension #nRows()): #dualRhs, #dualVec.
   Additional variables depending on representation (dimension coDim()):
   #addvec.

   @subsection Bounds 
   Dual and primal variables are bounded (including \f$\pm\infty\f$ as
   bounds).  If all primal variables are within their bounds, the
   Simplex basis is said to be primal feasible. Analogously, if all
   dual variables are within their bounds, its is called dual
   feasible.  If a basis is both, primal and dual feasible, the
   optimal solution is been found.

   In the dual Simplex, the basis is maintained to be dual, while
   primal feasibility is improved via basis updates. However, for
   numerical reasons dual feasibility must from time to time be
   relaxed.  Equivalently, primal feasibility will be relaxed to
   retain numerical stability in the primal Simplex algorithm.

   Relaxation of (dual or primal) feasibility is acchieved by
   enlarging the bounds to primal or dual variables. However, for each
   type of Simplex only the corresponding bounds need to be
   enlarged. Hence, we define only one vector of upper and lower bound
   for each row and column and initialize it with primal or dual
   bound, depending on the Simplex type.  (see #theURbound,
   #theLRbound, #theUCbound, #theLCbound.)
